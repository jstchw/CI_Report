    abstract = {Haloketones (HKs) is one class of disinfection by-products (DBPs) which is genetically toxic and mutagenic. Monitoring HKs in drinking water is important for drinking water safety, yet it is a time-consuming and laborious job. Developing predictive models of HKs to estimate their occurrence in drinking water is a good alternative, but to date no study was available for HKs modeling. This study was to explore the feasibility of linear, log linear regression models, back propagation (BP) as well as radial basis function (RBF) artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting HKs occurrence (including dichloropropanone, trichloropropanone and total HKs) in real water supply systems. Results showed that the overall prediction ability of RBF and BP ANNs was better than linear/log linear models. Though the BP ANN showed excellent prediction performance in internal validation (N25 = 98–100%, R2 = 0.99–1.00), it could not well predict HKs occurrence in external validation (N25 = 62–69%, R2 = 0.202–0.848). Prediction ability of RBF ANN in external validation (N25 = 85%, R2 = 0.692–0.909) was quite good, which was comparable to that in internal validation (N25 = 74–88%, R2 = 0.799–0.870). These results demonstrated RBF ANN could well recognized the complex nonlinear relationship between HKs occurrence and the related water quality, and paved a new way for HKs prediction and monitoring in practice.},

According to the actual situation of the robot searching maze, this algorithm improved the flood fill algorithm in maze-solving. Comparing with the results of using flood-fill algorithm directly, experiments show that this algorithm works better and more efficiently, and also, it has the advantage of little searching time and high speed of maze-solving. So it can be used to some areas like robot finding path.},

It has been applied to several real life applications and found to perform well compared to other genetic algorithms. This paper exploits the working of nomadic genetic algorithm (NGA) for benchmark mathematical functions and compares it with the standard genetic algorithm. To compare its performance with standard GA (SGA), the prominent mathematical functions used in optimization are used and the results proved that NGA outperforms SGA in terms of convergence speed and better optimized values.},
